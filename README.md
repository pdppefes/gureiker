# Gureiker
Gureiker - Research Group of the Basque University System on Online Media
The research group Gureiker will try to answer about which are the tools and spaces that the media use and offer users to open spaces of participation: What are the changes in the conception of authorship that are occurring due to the changes introduced by the so-called Web 2.0, and, consequently, what are the rules by which the media govern participation; How communities of users are created and maintained, and what are the relationships established in these communities; And what are the narrative and dialogical characteristics of the contents produced by the user.
Research lines:
- Analysis of online media
- The impact of the Internet on the media
- Participation of users in the contents of online media
- New informative and journalistic narratives for the Net
- Use of social networks for journalistic and corporate communication
